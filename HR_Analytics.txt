In this HR Analytics BI project, we aim to analyze employee attendance data, focusing on the number of work-from-home (WFH) and work-from-office (WFO) days taken by employees during the first three months of the financial year (April to June). The project involves collecting and examining attendance records to identify trends and patterns in employee work locations. Additionally, we will track instances of sick leave to understand health-related absenteeism. Based on this analysis, we will determine suitable days for team interactions, such as meetings, lunches, and team-building activities, ensuring maximum participation and engagement. This data-driven approach will help HR departments make informed decisions to enhance productivity and team cohesion.
